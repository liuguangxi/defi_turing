#problem-block(number: 14, title: [Longest Syracuse sequence], level: 1)[
In mathematics, a "Syracuse sequence" is a sequence of natural numbers defined as follows:

We start with an integer greater than zero; if it is even, we divide it by $2$; if it is odd, we multiply it by $3$ and add $1$.\
By repeating the operation, we obtain a sequence of positive integers, each of which depends only on its predecessor.

There is a conjecture that says that the Syracuse sequence of any strictly positive integer reaches $1$.

For example, starting from 14, we construct the sequence of numbers: $14$, $7$, $22$, $11$, $34$, $17$, $52$, $26$, $13$, $40$, $20$, $10$, $5$, $16$, $8$, $4$, $2$, $1$. This is called the Syracuse sequence of the number $14$. Here, it has a length of $18$.

A natural integer $k$ with $n$ digits is called a natural Kaprekar number if its square can be broken down into a right part with $n$ digits and a left part with $n$ or $n-1$ digits such that their sum is $k$.

$45$ is the $3$rd natural Kaprekar number, because $45^2 = 2025$ and $20 + 25 = 45$.\
$297$ is the $6$th natural Kaprekar number, because $297^2 = 88209$ and $88+209 = 297$.

The first $15$ natural Kaprekar numbers are: $1$, $9$, $45$, $55$, $99$, $297$, $703$, $999$, $2223$, $2728$, $4950$, $5050$, $7272$, $7777$, $9999$.

So I had the idea of replacing all the "$4$"s with other values, for example with "$3$"s.\
By doing so, it is clear that the sum obtained will be less than $F(n)$.\
To correct this slightly, I decided to replace the "$4$" alternately with a "$3$" and then with a "$5$", and I noted $S(n)$ as the sum of the $n$ numbers obtained.

For example, we have $S(6)=1+2+3+3+5+6=20$ and $F(6)=21$.\

It turns out that $F_541$, which contains $113$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are $1$-$9$-pandigital (all digits from $1$ to $9$ are present, but not necessarily in order).\
$F_2749$, which contains $575$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are $1$-$9$-pandigital.

Certain positive integers $n$ have the property that the sum $[n + op("mirror")(n)]$ consists entirely of odd digits.#footnote([$op("mirror")(n)$ means to reverse the (decimal) digits of the number $n$.]) For example, $36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313$. We will call these numbers "reversible"; therefore, $36$, $63$, $409$ and $904$ are reversible.\
Zeros are not allowed in the sum, nor at the end of the number $n$. For example, $10$ is not a reversible number, even though $10 + 01 = 11$.\

In this puzzle, you have to insert $+$ or $-$ signs between some of the numbers from $9$ to $1$ in order to obtain an exact equal sum.\
With seven addition and subtraction signs, you can write, for example: $9 + 8 + 76 + 5 + 4 - 3 + 2 - 1 = 100$. But there are $14$ other ways to write $100$, and it is possible to use fewer signs. For example, with only four signs, we get:
$ 98 - 76 + 54 + 3 + 21 = 100. $

We want to write as many consecutive natural numbers as possible in this way, using a minimum number of symbols. Here is a possible start:
- $9 + 8 - 76 - 5 + 43 + 21 = 0$
- $98 - 76 - 54 + 32 + 1 = 1$
- $9 + 87 - 65 + 4 - 32 - 1 = 2$
