#problem-block(number: 14, title: [Longest Syracuse sequence], level: 1)[
In mathematics, a "Syracuse sequence" is a sequence of natural numbers defined as follows:

We start with an integer greater than zero; if it is even, we divide it by $2$; if it is odd, we multiply it by $3$ and add $1$.\
By repeating the operation, we obtain a sequence of positive integers, each of which depends only on its predecessor.

There is a conjecture that says that the Syracuse sequence of any strictly positive integer reaches $1$.

For example, starting from $14$, we construct the sequence of numbers: $14$, $7$, $22$, $11$, $34$, $17$, $52$, $26$, $13$, $40$, $20$, $10$, $5$, $16$, $8$, $4$, $2$, $1$. This is called the Syracuse sequence of the number $14$. Here, it has a length of $18$.

We will use the notation $C(n)$ to represent the number of rectangular parallelepipeds that contain $n$ cubes in one of their layers. So, $C(22) = 2$, $C(46) = 4$, $C(78) = 5$, and $C(118) = 8$.\

Let $F(n)=1+2+3+dots.c+n$ be the sum of the first n non-zero integers.\
Before adding them up, I wanted to write all the integers from $1$ to $n$ on my computer. The only problem was that the "$4$" key on my keyboard wasn't working.
So I had the idea of replacing all the "$4$"s with other values, for example with "$3$"s.\
By doing so, it is clear that the sum obtained will be less than $F(n)$.\
To correct this slightly, I decided to replace the "$4$" alternately with a "$3$" and then with a "$5$", and I noted $S(n)$ as the sum of the $n$ numbers obtained.

For example, we have $S(6)=1+2+3+3+5+6=20$ and $F(6)=21$.\
Similarly, $S(20)=1+2+3+3+5+dots.c+12+13+15+15+16+dots.c+20=F(20)$.\

#problem-block(number: 210, title: [Cyclic numbers], level: 4)[
A cyclic number of length $n$ is a natural number whose circular permutations of digits correspond to the first $(n-1)$ multiples of the number. The best known (and smallest) is $142 thin 857$, of length $6$, because:
$
142 thin 857 times 2 = 285 thin 714\
142 thin 857 times 3 = 428 thin 571\
142 thin 857 times 4 = 571 thin 428\
142 thin 857 times 5 = 714 thin 285\
142 thin 857 times 6 = 857 thin 142
$

If zeros are not allowed at the beginning of numbers, then $142 thin 857$ is the only cyclic number in base $10$. However, if they are allowed, the list of cyclic numbers continues as follows:

$0588235294117647$ ($16$ digits); $052631578947368421$ ($18$ digits); ...

A prime number $p$ is said to be long if the period of the decimal expansion of $1\/p$ is of length $p-1$. For example: $1\/7 = 0.142857 142857 dots.c$ The period $(142857)$ is of length $6$, so $7$ is a long prime.

Note: The period of $1\/p$ always begins with the decimal expansion's tenths digit.

Now, extraordinarily, the list of cyclic numbers coincides exactly with the list of periods of long primes! Indeed, the second long prime is $17$, and we have $1\/17 = 0.0588235294117647 thin 0588235294117647 dots.c$

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all cyclic numbers with at most $n$ digits. Thus, $S(10) = 142 thin 857$ and $S(20) = 53 thin 219 thin 814 thin 241 thin 628 thin 925$.

#problem-block(number: 212, title: [Triangles from father to son], level: 4)[
Consider the following geometric transformation: given an initial triangle (the "father triangle"), take the feet of the bisectors of the old triangle as the vertices of the new triangle (the "son triangle").\
This transformation has the particularity of attenuating the differences between the angles of the initial triangle. Thus, if we iterate the process, two triangles that are initially different in shape will, via this transformation, lead to triangles that are increasingly "similar" and close to the common equilateral limit shape. This fact, far from being obvious, was only proven in 2006.\
On the other hand, it is clear that the sequence of iterated triangles converges to a point $G$. However, this point cannot be described explicitly (except in the case of the equilateral triangle, of course!).\
Let us now consider the simplest non-trivial case: let $A B C$ be an initial isosceles triangle with right angle at $A$, and $G$ the point of convergence of the sequence of iterated triangles.

*What is the value of $A G\/A B$, rounded to $10^(-9)$?* Enter the first $9$ decimal places of the result obtained.

#problem-block(number: 213, title: [Keith numbers], level: 2)[
A Keith number is an $n$-digit number $K$ with the following property: starting with numbers composed of each of the $n$ digits of $K$, a Fibonacci-like sequence is formed by calculating the sum of the last $n$ numbers in the sequence to determine the next number. If this sequence at some point yields the number $K$, that number is called a Keith number.

Example: $K = 197$\
$1, 9, 7, 17(=1+9+7), 33(=9+7+17), 57(=7+17+33), 107(=17+33+57), 197(=33+57+107)$

$197$ is therefore a Keith number. The length of the sequence generated by $197$ is $8$.

*Let all Keith numbers between $10$ and $1 thin 000 thin 000$ be given. Find the sum of all these numbers multiplied by the length of their sequence.*

#problem-block(number: 215, title: [The mystery triangle], level: 4)[
Given a triangle, let's take the symmetrical point of each vertex in relation to the opposite side or its extension. This gives us the vertices of a new triangle: the "reflected" triangle.\
If we repeat this process, we obtain a sequence of triangles whose evolution depends heavily on the shape of the initial triangle, hence the interest in studying it.\
Any triangle whose reflected triangle is similar to it is called a "fixed point" of this geometric transformation. Thus, there are only four types of "fixed points" for this transformation:

- Flattened triangles: it can also be noted that isosceles triangles with a main angle of $120 degree$ produce flattened triangles.
- The equilateral triangle, an "attractive" fixed point.
- the "heptagonal" triangle, whose angles are equal to fractions of $1\/7$, $2\/7$, and $4\/7$ of $180 degree$, and which is obtained from a regular heptagon by taking the first, second and fourth vertices.
- The "mystery" triangle, whose three (different) angles are probably not rational fractions of $180 degree$.

However, we do have two clues about this last triangle: like the "heptagonal" triangle, it has an obtuse angle and is a "repulsive" fixed point, meaning that a triangle with a very similar shape produces a reflected triangle with a less similar shape.

*What is the value in degrees, rounded to the nearest $10^(-5)$, of each of the two acute angles of the "mystery" triangle?* Enter the product of these two values, omitting the decimal point. The expected result is the exact product of two approximate values, not an approximate value of the best possible product.

On each graduation of the ruler, corresponding to a prime number, we place a beetle (which is reduced to a point of zero dimension).\
Each beetle moves at a speed of one unit per second. The first beetle (placed on $2$) moves to the right, the second (placed on $3$) to the left, the third (placed on $5$) to the right, and so on, alternately, until the last beetle placed on $997$, which moves to the left.\
When a beetle encounters another beetle, both beetles change direction and continue to travel along the ruler, still at the same speed of one unit per second.\

+ We observe the sequence of cards. If it is already sorted, then there is no need to continue the action. Otherwise, if there are sequences of cards arranged in ascending order without any "gaps", then these sequences form groups of cards that are stapled together.\ For example, with $7$ cards initially in the order $4 med 1 med 2 med 3 med 7 med 5 med 6$, cards $1$, $2$ and $3$ will be stapled together, as will cards $5$ and $6$ (this gives us a group of 3 cards, a group of $2$ cards, and $2$ isolated cards).
+ The cards are then "shuffled" by throwing them into the air (the stapled cards obviously remain together). The cards (or stapled card packs) are then picked up at random. We assume that all possible picks are equally likely, despite the fact that some cards are alone and others are grouped together.
+ Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until all the cards are sorted.

Let $S(n)$ be the average number of tosses required to sort all the cards (this is therefore an expectation). Since the order is checked before the first toss, we have $S(1) = 0$.\

A "sandwich" number is a number with $3n$ digits whose middle section (the number written with the $n$ middle digits) is equal to the sum of the first section (the number written with the first $n$ digits) and the last section (the number written with the last $n$ digits).

For example, $203818$ is a sandwich number because $20 + 18 = 38$.

*What is the smallest sandwich number that is a multiple of $2018$ and contains the sequence of consecutive digits $2$, $0$, $1$, $8$?* ($203818$ is not suitable because $2$, $0$, $1$ and $8$ are not consecutive).

For any positive integer $n$, we define the function $F$ by $F(n)=k$ where $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that $n + k$ is not divisible by $k + 1$.

Examples
+ $13$ is divisible by $1$, $14$ is divisible by $2$, $15$ is divisible by $3$, $16$ is divisible by $4$, but $17$ is NOT divisible by $5$. Therefore, $F(13) = 4$.

Let $n$ be a strictly positive integer with p digits.\
Let $F$ be the function that, for any $n$, associates the number obtained by the following process: starting from $n$, we write $p$ numbers, such that each of them is the sum of the $p$-th powers of the digits of the previous one.

Example: $213 -> 2^3+1^3+3^3 = 36 -> 3^3+6^3 = 243 -> 2^3+4^3+3^3 = 99$. Thus, $F(213) = 99$.

Let $G$ be the function that, for any strictly positive integer $p$, associates the largest value of $F(n)$ obtained when $n$ describes the set of $p$-digit integers.

Examples:\
$G(1) = 9$, because $F(9) = 91 = 9$.\
$G(2) = 145$, because $F(58) = F(77) = F(85) = 145$.\
Indeed, $58$ and $85$ give $5^2+8^2 = 89$ and $77$ gives $7^2+7^2 = 98$ after one iteration.\
And since it is impossible to obtain $99$ after one iteration from a $2$-digit integer, $8^2+9^2 = 145$ is indeed the largest integer that can be obtained in the second iteration from a $2$-digit number.

Let $H$ be the function that, for any strictly positive integer $p$, associates the smallest $p$-digit antecedent of $G(p)$ with $F$.

Examples: $H(1) = 9$ and $H(2) = 58$.

Frodo and Sam must travel $100$ leagues eastward to get from point $A$ to point $B$.\
On normal terrain, they can cover $10$ leagues per day; under these conditions, the journey would therefore take $10$ days.\

The swamp consists of five distinct regions, each $10$ leagues wide, as shown by the different colors on the map.\
The strip closest to point $A$ is a relatively easy swamp; it can be crossed at a speed of $9$ leagues per day.\
However, each strip becomes progressively more difficult to negotiate, with speeds decreasing successively to $8$, $7$, $6$ and finally $5$ leagues per day for the last region of the swamp.\
Then the marsh ends abruptly and the terrain returns to normal, with a speed of $10$ leagues per day.\
If Frodo and Sam were to travel in a straight line eastward from $A$ to $B$, they would travel exactly $100$ leagues, and the journey would take approximately $13.4738$ days.
However, this time can be reduced if they agree to deviate from the "straight path".
